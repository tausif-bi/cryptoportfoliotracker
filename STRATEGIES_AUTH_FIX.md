# Strategies Authentication Fix

## Issue
The strategies were not showing because the endpoints now require authentication (for security), but the frontend was trying to access them without authentication tokens.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Updated StrategiesScreen.js**
- Added `exchangeService` import for authenticated requests
- Added `authService` import to check login status
- Updated `fetchStrategies()` to use authenticated requests
- Updated `runStrategyAnalysis()` to use authenticated requests
- Added login check before fetching strategies
- Added proper error handling for authentication errors
- Removed hardcoded baseURL

### 2. **Changes Made**
```javascript
// Before (no authentication):
const response = await fetch(`${baseURL}/api/strategies/list`);

// After (with authentication):
const data = await exchangeService.makeAuthenticatedRequest('/strategies/list', {}, 'GET');
```

## How It Works Now

1. **When the Strategies screen loads:**
   - Checks if user is logged in
   - If not logged in, shows empty strategies list
   - If logged in, fetches strategies with authentication token

2. **When running a strategy:**
   - Sends authenticated request with JWT token
   - If token expired/invalid, prompts to log in

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Authentication errors show "Login Required" alert
   - Directs user to Profile screen to log in

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test without login:**
   - Log out (if logged in)
   - Go to Strategies tab
   - Should see "No strategies available" (expected)

2. **Test with login:**
   - Go to Profile tab
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Go back to Strategies tab
   - Should see list of strategies

3. **Test strategy analysis:**
   - Select a strategy
   - Choose a trading pair
   - Run analysis
   - Should see results with charts

## If Strategies Still Don't Show

1. **Check if you're logged in:**
   - Go to Profile tab
   - If it shows login form, you need to log in
   - If it shows profile info, you're logged in

2. **Check backend is running:**
   - Make sure the Flask server is running
   - Check console for any errors

3. **Clear app cache:**
   - Force close the app
   - Clear app data/cache
   - Restart the app
   - Log in again

## Backend Verification

To verify the backend is working correctly:

```bash
# Check if strategies endpoint requires auth (should return 401)
curl http://192.168.0.177:5000/api/strategies/list

# Response should be:
# {"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Authentication is required to access this resource.","success":false}
```

This confirms the security is working as intended!
